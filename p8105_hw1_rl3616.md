library(moderndive)               #Attach the moderndive package

```

# Problem 1

This dataset has “358” rows and “15” columns.

Variables include: “origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid,
wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour”.

Mean temperature (F): “39.58”.

``` r
p <- ggplot(early_january_weather, 
  aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +      #initialize and setting up a ggplot object
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +                           #setting point transparency
  scale_x_datetime(
    date_breaks = "2 day",
    date_labels = "%d"
  ) +                                                 #customize x-axis scale for datetime data
  labs(
    title = "Temperature vs Time (colored by Humidity)",
    x = "Time in January (hourly data)",
    y = "Temperature (F)",
    color = "Humidity"
  ) +                                                 #set plot labels
  theme_minimal()                                     #apply a theme I love♡

p                                                     #show the garph
```

In the chart, each vertical line represents 0:00 a.m. of that day (e.g.,
the line labeled “02” corresponds to 0:00 a.m. on January 2). We can see
that temperature peaks typically occur during the daytime between two
midnights, while temperature troughs usually appear near 0:00 a.m. each
day.

Lighter blue dots indicate higher humidity.High nighttime humidity often
leads to larger diurnal temperature swings (e.g., from January 6 to 11)
and can cause sharp temperature drops (e.g., around January 15).
Meanwhile, persistently high humidity tends to reduce diurnal
temperature variation (e.g., from noon on January 11 to January 14).
